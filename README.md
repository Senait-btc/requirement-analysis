# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository focuses on Requirement Analysis in Software Development, which is the first and most critical phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
The purpose of this repository is to document and demonstrate the process of gathering, analyzing, and defining software requirements to ensure that the final product meets user needs and business objectives.

It includes materials such as:

- Definitions and types of requirements (functional and non-functional)

- Techniques for requirement elicitation and analysis

- Use case examples and documentation templates

- Real-world case studies and diagrams illustrating requirement modeling
# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
  Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. ‚úÖ Clear Understanding of Project Scope
Requirement analysis ensures that developers, stakeholders, and clients have a shared understanding of what the software should do. It defines the boundaries of the project, preventing scope creep and misaligned expectations.

2. üõ†Ô∏è Better System Design
By identifying functional and non-functional requirements early, teams can design systems that meet user needs efficiently. It helps in choosing the right architecture, technologies, and workflows, reducing rework and technical debt.

3. üí∞ Cost and Time Efficiency
Thorough requirement analysis minimizes errors and misunderstandings, which can lead to costly revisions later. It allows for accurate project planning, budgeting, and scheduling‚Äîsaving time and resources throughout development.
# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
- Requirement Gathering:-
  Requirement Gathering is the foundational step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where project stakeholders identify, collect, and document what the software system needs to achieve. It ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business   goals.
- Requirement Elicitation:-
  Requirement Elicitation is the process of actively gathering information from stakeholders to understand what a software system must do. It‚Äôs a critical step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that ensures the final product meets user needs and business goals.
- Requirement Documentation:-
  Requirement Documentation is the process of recording all the gathered and elicited requirements in a structured format that guides the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). It serves as a formal agreement between stakeholders and the development team, ensuring clarity, consistency, and traceability throughout the project.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling:-
  Requirement Analysis and Modeling are essential steps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that help transform user needs into a structured blueprint for system design and development.
- Requirement Validation:-
  Requirement Validation is the process of ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectations of stakeholders and are feasible for implementation. It is a critical step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that helps prevent costly errors later in the project.
# Types of Requirements.
## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements are the core actions and operations the system must perform to meet user needs. They are typically derived from use cases, business rules, and stakeholder expectations.

üßæ Examples for a Booking Management Project:
1. üóìÔ∏è Create a Booking
Users must be able to select a date, time, and service to create a booking.

The system should validate availability before confirming the booking.

2. üîç View Booking Details
Users and admins can view booking information including date, time, service, and status.

Admins can filter bookings by customer name, date range, or service type.

3. ‚úèÔ∏è Modify or Cancel a Booking
Users can update or cancel their bookings within a defined time window.

The system should send confirmation emails upon changes.

4. üìß Send Notifications
The system must send email or SMS reminders to users before their scheduled booking.

Admins receive alerts for new or canceled bookings.

5. üîê User Authentication
Users must log in or register to access booking features.

Admins have elevated access to manage all bookings and user accounts.

6. üìä Generate Reports
Admins can generate daily, weekly, or monthly booking reports.

Reports include metrics like total bookings, cancellations, and peak hours.
## Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements specify the criteria used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors or functions. They are crucial for user satisfaction and system performance.

üßæ Examples for a Booking Management Project:
1. ‚ö° Performance
The system must handle up to 500 concurrent users without performance degradation.

Booking confirmation should be processed within 2 seconds of submission.

2. üîê Security
All user data must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption.

Users must authenticate using multi-factor authentication (MFA) before accessing their accounts.

3. üì± Usability
The interface should be mobile-responsive and accessible on all major browsers.

New users should be able to complete a booking within 3 minutes without training.

4. üïí Availability
The system should be available 99.9% of the time, excluding scheduled maintenance.

Maintenance windows must be announced at least 48 hours in advance.

5. üîÑ Scalability
The system should be able to scale to support double the current user base without major architectural changes.
# Use Case Diagrams.
Use Case Diagrams are a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that visually represent the interactions between users (called "actors") and a system to achieve specific goals. They are commonly used during the requirements analysis phase of software development to capture functional requirements.
üåü Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
1. ‚úÖ Clarifies Functional Requirements
Helps stakeholders understand what the system will do from a user‚Äôs perspective.

2. ü§ù Improves Communication
Bridges the gap between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders using simple visuals.

3. üß† Supports Design and Testing
Guides developers in system design and helps testers create relevant test cases.

4. üì¶ Organizes Scope
Clearly defines what‚Äôs inside and outside the system‚Äôs boundaries, helping manage scope.

# Acceptance Criteria.
Acceptance Criteria are essential in Requirement Analysis because they define the specific conditions under which a requirement is considered successfully implemented. They serve as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, ensuring clarity, alignment, and quality throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
üßæ User Story
As a customer, I want to complete my booking through a secure checkout process, So that I can confirm my reservation and receive a payment receipt.

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
Booking Summary Displayed

Given the user has selected a service and time slot,

When they proceed to checkout,

Then the system must display a summary including service details, date, time, and total cost.

Payment Options Available

Given the user is on the checkout page,

When they choose to pay,

Then the system must offer at least two payment methods (e.g., credit card, mobile wallet).

Secure Payment Processing

Given the user enters valid payment details,

When they submit the payment,

Then the system must process the payment securely and confirm success or failure.

Confirmation Message Sent

Given the payment is successful,

When the transaction is complete,

Then the system must send a confirmation email or SMS with booking and payment details.

Error Handling

Given the payment fails,

When the user is notified,

Then the system must allow them to retry or choose a different payment method.

# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository focuses on Requirement Analysis in Software Development, which is the first and most critical phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
The purpose of this repository is to document and demonstrate the process of gathering, analyzing, and defining software requirements to ensure that the final product meets user needs and business objectives.

It includes materials such as:

- Definitions and types of requirements (functional and non-functional)

- Techniques for requirement elicitation and analysis

- Use case examples and documentation templates

- Real-world case studies and diagrams illustrating requirement modeling
# What is Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
  Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
